# Create a Datapack Fast and Easily

This very simple CLI can generate a default data pack folder structure, while also generating global advancements that allow the pack to integrate with other datapacks.

 [You can check the datapack conventions here](https://ooboomberoo.github.io/mcdatapacks-wiki/conventions/datapack_advancement.html)

## Usage
[Install nodejs](https://nodejs.org) 

then type in your **terminal** to install the CLI globally:
```
npm i -g @macro21kgb@create-datapack
```
After that you can create a new datapack in the current directory with
```
create-datapack
```
or
```
npx create-datapack
```
